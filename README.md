# Full-Website-For-Company-Startup

# For every script that I've build, I used XAMPP servers
The HTML file goes in htdocs and the CGI file goes into the cgi folder.

This is a very complex website. It has a lot of scripts and a good built security sistem.
I also used something called UEC (User Entry Code) for adding a little bit more security to the company.
I used some generators to create a database for the "workers". In reality, when I build something like this for a customer, they give me their DB and their UEC so that I know how to build the security system.

For questions or more information, contact me.
